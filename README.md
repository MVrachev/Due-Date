# End-Date

## Motivation

This is a task manager whose focus is mostly on the idea that all tasks should be sorted by their due date.

The idea of that project came when I realized I have many stuff in my to-do list. Normally I will add them in different fashion so they are not sorted in any way.

I wanted to have a sorted to-do list. I was curious how can I implement such a thing with a UI, synchronization with my android phone and so on.


 
## Functionalities and insights

The elements in my app consists of four attributes:

< Due date > < Priority > < Description > < Status >
  
1. Logging into the system with name and password
2. Adding, editing, deleting an element
3. Mark element as “done”/“undone”
4. Choose how to display the elements: sorted by date or by priority
5. Display all elements or part from the elements. By part I mean all elements which are finishing in this week, month, three month, year or have hight, medium or low priority.
6. Display all finished tasks and option to display them next to the regular tasks.

## In future I plan to add:
- The ability to use shared list by many users.
- An admin of every shared list who decide which people to include in the shared list and delegates tasks.

## Further future plans

I plan to create an Android application. I want to synchronize this application and my android application.
